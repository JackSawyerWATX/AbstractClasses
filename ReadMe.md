An abstract class is a class which cannot be instantiated directly using the class' constructor, and is used with inheritance to create superclasses in which other, specific implementation can exist. Abstract classes also provide the benefit of being able to declare abstract methods within the class, which enforces a subclass to provide an overridden version of that method.

To create an abstract class, simply use the keyword abstract in the class definition. You can declare methods as abstract within a class, if the class is also abstract. When a method is declared as abstract you cannot declare a body for the method.

Here, I am using the keyword extends to establish that Guitar is a subclass of the Instrument class. Since Guitar is not abstract, we now need to override the abstract method sound() which was inherited. Note that I included the @Override annotation in this snippet. The annotation is not actually required, but I've included it since the annotation communicates clearly which method was inherited, and that I am explicitly changing the functionality. When a non-abstract subclass inherits abstract methods, the class must provide an implementation for the method.
